= Building REST Services with Spring

* Suitable actions (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, ...)
* Caching
* Redirection and forwarding
* Security (encryption and authentication)


By building on top of HTTP, REST APIs provide the means to build:

* Backwards compatible APIs
* Evolvable APIs
* Scaleable services
* Securable services
* A spectrum of stateless to stateful services
